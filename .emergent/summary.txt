<analysis>**original_problem_statement**: The user wants to build a full-stack e-commerce application named GAZ MAN for selling gas cylinders and related services. The user provided four detailed specification documents (cahier de charges) in French and requested that the UI be matched exactly. The project is to be built incrementally in phases, starting with a client-facing MVP.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS (MVP - Phases 1, 2, 3)**:
1.  **Authentication**: Standard email/password registration, login, and password reset.
2.  **Core Shopping**: Browse a catalog of gas products, search, filter, view product details, and add items to a shopping cart.
3.  **Checkout Flow**: A complete checkout process including delivery address, phone number, mock payment selection, and order confirmation.
4.  **Order Management**: Users must be able to view their order history and the status of each order.
5.  **Delivery Tracking**: A page showing the delivery status and a simulated real-time map of the delivery.
6.  **UI/UX**: A premium, modern, mobile-first design inspired by the GOZEM app, using a Dark Blue/Orange/White color scheme.
7.  **Currency**: All prices must be in Cameroon's currency (XAF) and formatted as FCFA (e.g., 12 000 FCFA).

**User's preferred language**: English for conversation, but all UI text and content should be in **French**.

**what currently exists?**
A full-stack application with a React frontend and a FastAPI backend.
-   **Backend**: Features fully implemented and tested via  for authentication (JWT), product catalog, cart management (add, view, update), and order creation/retrieval. Product data is seeded into a MongoDB database.
-   **Frontend**: The UI is substantially complete for the MVP. This includes authentication pages, a redesigned GOZEM-style homepage acting as a service gateway, redesigned product catalog and detail pages, a shopping cart, a checkout page with a prefixed Cameroon phone number input, and an order success page. All prices are correctly formatted in FCFA.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working**: The user reported that deleting an item from the shopping cart is not working. The agent started investigating the backend code to diagnose the issue.
-   **Status**: IN PROGRESS
-   **Agent Testing Done**: N
-   **Which testing method agent to use?**: backend testing agent (using ) to validate the API fix, followed by the frontend testing agent to confirm the end-to-end UI functionality.
-   **User Testing Done**: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   **Issue 1**:  (P0) Cart item deletion is not working.

**Issues Detail**:
-   **Issue 1**:
    -   **Description**: When the user clicks the delete icon for an item in the shopping cart, the item is not removed. The user is blocked from managing their cart effectively.
    -   **Attempted fixes**: The agent identified that a similar bug with update quantity was caused by a mismatch between the frontend sending a JSON body and the backend expecting query parameters. The agent has started viewing  to check the delete endpoint's implementation.
    -   **Next debug checklist**:
        1.  Analyze the  endpoint in  to confirm how it receives parameters.
        2.  Review the  function in  to see how the API request is constructed.
        3.  Modify the backend endpoint, likely by adding a Pydantic model to the function signature, to correctly accept the request data from the frontend.
        4.  Restart the backend server using backend: stopped
backend: started.
        5.  Test the API endpoint directly using  to confirm the fix.
        6.  Verify the end-to-end flow on the frontend.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: This is a critical bug that prevents users from managing their shopping cart, blocking the core purchase workflow. Fixing it will restore essential e-commerce functionality.
    -   **Status**: IN PROGRESS
    -   **Is recurring issue?**: Y (This is the third cart-related API endpoint to have this specific parameter-handling issue).
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Both.
    -   **Blocked on other issue**: None. This is the primary blocker.

**In progress Task List**:
-   **Task 1**: Implement Phase 3.4 - Orders List Page.
    -   **Where to resume**: The file  has been created but is empty. The task involves building the UI to fetch and display a list of the user's orders from the  endpoint. Each item should show Order ID, Date, Status, and Total Price.
    -   **What will be achieved with this?**: Users will be able to view their complete order history.
    -   **Status**: NOT STARTED
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Frontend.
    -   **Blocked on something**: This task is blocked until the critical Delete from Cart issue is resolved, as per user instructions.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
-   **Upcoming Tasks (Phase 3 MVP)**:
    -   **(P0) Phase 3.5 - Order Details Page**: Create a page to display the full details of a single order, linked from the My Orders list.
    -   **(P1) Phase 3.6 - Order Tracking Page**: Implement the visual, GOZEM-style status timeline ( ->  -> etc.) on the Order Details page.
    -   **(P2) User Profile Page**: Create the user profile page, which will serve as the entry point to the My Orders list and other user settings.

-   **Future Tasks (Postponed)**:
    -   **Phase 4**: Delivery Driver Application.
    -   **Phase 5**: Administrator Dashboard.

**Completed work in this session**
-   **Phase 1 - Foundation & Auth (DONE)**: Backend models, JWT authentication, and frontend auth pages are complete.
-   **Phase 2 - Core Shopping Experience (DONE)**: Backend APIs for products and cart created. Frontend features a GOZEM-style redesign for the Homepage, Product Catalog, and Product Detail pages. Currency is correctly set to FCFA.
-   **Phase 3 - Checkout Flow (Partially DONE)**: Backend order creation APIs are complete. Frontend has a full checkout flow from cart to an order success page.
-   **Critical Bug Fixes**:
    -   Fixed an issue where items were not persisting in the cart across pages.
    -   Fixed a bug preventing cart item quantity updates.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Frontend**: React, Tailwind CSS, React Router, Axios for API calls, React Context for auth state.
-   **Backend**: FastAPI, MongoDB with Motor (async), Pydantic for data validation, JWT for authentication.
-   **Architecture**: Full-stack SPA with a REST API.

**key DB schema**
-   : {id, name, email, password_hash, role, address}
-   : {id, name, brand, price (integer), stock, image_url, description}
-   : {user_id, items: [{product_id, quantity, price}], subtotal, total}
-   : {user_id, items: [...], total, status, delivery_address, created_at}

**changes in tech stack**
-   None.

**All files of reference**
-   : Contains all backend API logic, including the broken cart delete endpoint.
-   : The UI component where the delete action is triggered.
-   : The next file to be implemented after the current bug is fixed.
-   : Contains all frontend routing.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   The cart API endpoints in  have repeatedly caused bugs due to inconsistent request handling (query params vs. JSON body). It would be beneficial to refactor all cart endpoints to standardize on using Pydantic models for request bodies.

**key api endpoints**
-   
-    (Login)
-   
-   
-    (Update quantity)
-    **(CURRENTLY BROKEN)**
-   
-   

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   Your immediate priority is to fix the delete item from cart bug. The user wants this resolved before any new features are added.
-   The root cause is likely a parameter handling mismatch in the FastAPI backend, a pattern seen in two previous cart-related bugs. The fix involves using a Pydantic  for the request body in the endpoint signature.
-   The UI/UX must follow the premium GOZEM-style established in the Homepage and Product pages. All new UI must be consistent with this design language.
-   All currency must be displayed in FCFA (e.g., 12 000 FCFA). Prices are stored as integers in the backend.

**documents and test reports created in this job**
-   None.
